 * Capture device files, e.g. /dev/sda, in a Java class.  Device file
 * here nearly always means 'whole disks', like /dev/sda or 'C:'.

 * We use native methods to derive DeviceFile ids (vendor info, serial
 * number etc) and disk sizes (since File.length() returns 0 on a
 * device file).  There is no 'regular' Java API for obtaining a
 * disk's vendor/serial details, which is very platform-specific.
